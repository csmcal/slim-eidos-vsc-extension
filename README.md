# slim-eidos README

![SLiM Icon](images/SLiM_256.jpg)

This VSCode extension is built to provide grammar highlighting in Eidos scripts. Eidos is the domain-specific language used within the SLiM framework to simulate the genetics of a population forward-in-time.

## Features

![Highlighting and Hover Functionality](images/highlight_hover.png)

Grammar highlighting includes comments, keywords, etc.

Only .slim files are automatically associated with eidos grammar, as .txt is too broadly used. If you are not seeing grammar highlighting and this is the issue, consider changing .txt files to .slim files, or manually change the language mode by clicking on the button in the bottom right of VS Code and related editors.

Completions, snippets, hover and diagnostic providers coded with the help of Cursor and Claude.

<!-- ## Extension Settings
